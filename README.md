Here is an explanation of how this hangman code works:

# Hangman Game Explanation

## Imports and Constants

```python
import random
```

- Imports the random module to generate a random word  

```python 
hangman = (""" diagram strings """)
```

- Contains strings with ASCII diagrams of the hangman in different states.

```python
max_wrong = len(hangman) - 1
```  

- Max number of wrong guesses allowed, based on number of hangman diagrams

```python
words = ("word1", "word2", ...) 
```


- List of words to pick from as the secret word

## Game Initialization

```python
botWord = random.choice(words)
```

- Picks a random word from the word list for the bot's word

```python
so_far = "*" * len(botWord) 
```

- Initializes so_far string to asterisks matching length of bot's word

```python
wrongGeusses = 0
used = []
```

- Initializes number of wrong guesses to 0
- Initializes empty list to track letters used

## Main Game Loop

```python
while wrongGeusses < max_wrong and so_far != botWord:
```

- Main game loop runs while under max wrong guesses and not fully guessed

```python
print hangman diagram based on wrongGeusses  
```

- Prints appropriate hangman diagram for current wrong guess count

```python
Print guesses used and word progress so far
```

- Prints letters used and the word with guessed letters revealed

```python 
Get player's guess
```

- Get player's letter guess input

```python
Check if letter already used
``` 

- Check if letter has been guessed before, prompt for new guess

```python
Add guess to used list
```

- Stores all guesses in used list

```python
Check if guess in word and update so_far
```

- Checks if guess is in word. If so, reveals in so_far. Else increase wrongGeusses.

```python
Print win/lose result 
```

- After loop ends, print final win/lose result
